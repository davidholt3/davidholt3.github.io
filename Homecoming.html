    <h1><B>Homecoming</B></h1>
    <p>Homecoming is my favorite day of the year.  It gives me the oppurtinity to sociale with my family, friends, teachers and new people all in one place.  The fall climate creates the perfect backdrop to watch my favorite sport; football.  However, I enjoy the homecoming tailgate more than the actual football game, as it allows me to reconnect with friends who have graduated and celebrate again with them, if only just for a day.  It also allows me the chance to introduce my family to the people I have surrounded myself with at school and let them be a part of and see my life in college.  Homecoming also is a good way to say goodbye to the warmer days of summer and fall, as the nights get colder and snow begins to set in for UMaine's four year long winter.</p>
