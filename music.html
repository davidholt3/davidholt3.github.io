<p>If it sounds good, I enjoy listening to it.  My taste in music encompasses a wide variety of genres, everything from 80's music to soundcloud remixes.  I enjoy listening to rap when I am out at night on the weekends, but also appreciate playing Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver with the windows down on a nice day.  However, my favorite music to listen to is upbeat EDM that makes me want to dance until I remember that I am a horrible dancer. </p>
