    <h2><B>My Hobbies</B></h2>
<body>
<p>My hobbies include socializing and recreational water activities. During the summer I often spend a great deal of my time on the Belgrade Lakes and on the ocean in the midcoast area.  On hot summer days you will often find me steering a boat on the lake or being towed behind one on a water skii or tube.  I also have a deep enjoyment for both paddleboarding and kayaking, which I attribute to multiple years of experience as a paddle board instructor and tour guide at a coastal resort in Southern Maine. During my time as an instructor I also worked as a kids camp councilor for sea kayak and fishing camps.  Becuase of these experiences I often enjoy fishing on Long Pond during the summer months. </p>
