<p>I am currently entering the second semester of my junior year at UMaine.  After spending the first two years of undergrad as a Civil Engineering major and business minor, I decided to follow my passion and become a finance major.  When I'm not studying in the library I enjoy staying physically active and spending time with friends.  During the first three weeks of the school year when the temperature is above freezing, my favorite past time is floating down the Stillwater with my friends and playing volleyball outside.  I have lived in Maine my whole life and graduated from Brunswick High School in Southern Maine.</p>
